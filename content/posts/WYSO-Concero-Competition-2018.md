#### This was my second WYSO concerto competition performance (I previously competed in the 2016 competition). I won this competition, alongside 3 other musicians Grace Kim, Benjamin Davies Hudson, and Ellen Zhou. I would later perform _In Ireland_ with the Wisconsin Chamber Orchestra on May 21, 2019.
