      <description> Date: 2013 Location: Lakeside Lutheran Piece: Composer: somebody Accompanist:  This was my first flute performance ever! I was in 5th grade, studying under Peter Ziegler at the time. I was really nervous for this performance because the room was filled with many people, who likely were waiting for the next performer. In the end I bowed because I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what else to do! </description>
